/* Main entrance for communication.
 *
 * Each peer may have multiple communicators, used for different or even the same means
 * of types of connections. For example, the master can listen to UNIX domain sockets
 * and internet connections, possibly on multiple ports.
 * However, we advise you to only use multiple communicators for the master, since it
 * makes no sense that a slave has multiple connections.
 * For the future, it is planned that the library does not allow this on its own.
 * But for the moment, you have to take care of this yourself. See the test for
 * an example.
 *
 * The peer has a list of communicators, which are responsible for the connection to
 * the other peers/slaves or to the master. Each peer has an unique id, the master
 * being 0. Messages can be sent to all peers or just to one specific peer.
 *
 * Messages are retrieved by ems_peer_get_message. You can wait for incoming messages
 * with ems_peer_wait_for_message or ems_peer_wait_for_message_timeout as long
 * as the peer is alive.
